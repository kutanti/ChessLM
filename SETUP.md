## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- API keys for AI providers (optional, for AI features)

### Setup
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Add your API keys to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Starting a Game
1. **Select Game Mode**: Choose from Human vs AI or AI vs AI
2. **Pick AI Models**: Select which models to play against or watch compete
3. **Configure Settings**: Adjust time controls and other preferences
4. **Start Playing**: Begin your chess adventure

### Playing Chess
- **Click to Move**: Click on a piece, then click on the destination square
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag pieces to their destination
- **AI Thinking**: Watch the AI analyze positions in real-time
- **Move Analysis**: See detailed reasoning for each AI move

### Features in Detail

#### Game Modes
### Core Game Modes

## API Integration

### Supported Providers
- **OpenAI**: GPT models via OpenAI API
- **Anthropic**: Claude models via Anthropic API  
- **Replicate**: Llama models via Replicate API

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/ai-move`: Generate AI moves with reasoning

## Competitive Analysis

ChessLM addresses gaps identified in existing chess AI platforms:

### Key Differentiators
1. **Unified Platform**: Supports both human vs AI and AI vs AI with consistent UI/UX
2. **Multiple Providers**: Integrates OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models
3. **Real-time Analysis**: Live move reasoning and position evaluation
4. **Production Quality**: Polished interface designed for general users
5. **Educational Focus**: Detailed explanations help players learn

### Comparison with Existing Solutions
- **LLMsChess**: Similar concept but ChessLM offers better UX and more model variety
- **LLM Chess Arena**: Good for AI battles but lacks human vs AI polish
- **Chess-with-LLM**: Basic implementation; ChessLM provides comprehensive features
